Commons Machinery graphics and logotypes
========================================

This repository contains the graphics and logotypes in use by Commons
Machinery. Here's some general guidelines about their use:

 * The character's name is "Humphrey Tin"
 * In general, we prefer the use of the vertical logotype
 * If needing a logotype which is purely a square, it's acceptable to use only
   Humphrey.
 * IMPORTANT: Please note that whatever the application, there are two
   different versions of Humphrey. One is meant for applications against a
   dark background, and one for applications against a light background.
   Do NOT try to invert the logotype, it will not look nice.
